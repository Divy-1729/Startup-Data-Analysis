The project is basically reading data from a csv file named ‘Unicorn_Clean.csv’ (Data obtained from Kaggle.com) which contains records of 935 Startups present across the world. It contains information such as movie Company Valuation ($B), Date Joined, Country, City, Industry, Investor 1, Investor 2, Investor 3, etc.

It is a menu driven project and we have given options for Showing data, searching specific data and for Data Visualization where we have displayed different types of charts such as Bar chart, Line chart and Histogram, using matplotlib library of python.

In this project, we have used Python as a programming language, PyCharm as IDE, and a CSV file for data analysis.
